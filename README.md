## Data analyst pursuing the Microsoft PL-300: Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst qualification 

Welcome to my GitHub page! I am a data analyst and chemistry master's graduate with a diverse skill set, having also completed the AiCore Immersive Programme for Data Analysis. 

## About me
I have a strong foundation in research and development and a passion for technology. My experience performing data analysis both during my degree and in an AR tech company after university drove me to seek the opportunity to grow my expertise through the AiCore Immersive Programme. During this 12-week intensive curriculum, I sharpened my skills through practical learning and projects with real-world applications. I received extensive training in databases, data preprocessing, manipulation, and visualisation, coupled with a strong foundation in software engineering principles, and gained proficiency in a wide range of technical domains. I am capable and confident in exploring and interpreting data, extracting meaningful insights, and turning raw information into actionable intelligence. I am currently pursuing the Microsoft PL-300: Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst qualification to further expand my capabilites.
